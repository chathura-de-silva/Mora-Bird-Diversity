\section{Data Collection Methodology}
As mentioned above the data collection for this study occurred from October 2021 to March 2024. The process included random observations carried out consistently during this period, and certain nocturnal bird species were identified based on their distinctive calls. Starting from January 2024, a roundup of special observations was conducted, encompassing the entire university to ensure comprehensive documentation of all bird species.
\\\\
To create the final comprehensive checklist of bird species, the data collected by both authors was merged.

\subsection{Limitations}
 Random observations inherently possess limitations, compounded by the potential for overlooking certain university regions due to challenging accessibility. However, the special observations conducted at the end of the period of study should have minimized the effects of this to some extent. Furthermore, observations across various areas may lack uniform frequency, introducing variability. Additionally, the two authors conducted overlapping yet distinct observations during disparate time periods.

\section{Climate}
The University of Moratuwa is located in the Low Country Wet Zone.The area experiences annual precipitation, primarily brought by the southwest monsoon from May to September. Additionally, inter-monsoon rains occur in March-April and October-November. Although January tends to be drier, there is no distinctly defined dry season. The average temperature hovers around 27 degrees Celsius, accompanied by a relative humidity of approximately 90\%[1].

\section{Eco-systems}
The observation reveals that various bird species exhibit a diverse range of habitat preferences, encompassing both entirely natural ecosystems and human-made ecosystems situated within and in close proximity to the university.
\\\\
The neighboring regions of Bolgoda Lake and the Kaju Kele area can be categorized as natural ecosystems, whereas spaces like gardens and the university playground fall under the classification of human-made ecosystems. Notably, even in entirely artificial environments, the study records the presence of certain bird species while some of the species are strictly restricted to certain areas of the university.

\subsection{Hotspots}
During the study, two hotspots were identified inside the above ecosystems which have recorded an exceptionally high number of bird species.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Boat Yard and the open land stripe with a lineup of trees between the Department of Civil Engineering and the Bolgoda lake.
    \item Upon entering 'Kaju Kele' from the end where the boat yard is situated, the open area to the left side near the first security guard room.
