\section{Rarity of Species}
While some of the species recorded are very common in university premises and some others are relatively rare, there were even some species that was recorded only once during the period of study.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Indian Golden Oriole (\textit{Oriolus kundoo})
    \item Painted Stork (\textit{Mycteria leucocephala})
