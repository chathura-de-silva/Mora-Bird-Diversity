\section{Rarity of Species}
While some of the species recorded are very common in the university premises, some others are relatively rare. There were even some species that were recorded only once during the period of study.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Indian Golden Oriole (\textit{Oriolus kundoo})
    \item Painted Stork (\textit{Mycteria leucocephala})
    \item Changeable Hawk-Eagle (\textit{Nisaetus cirrhatus})
