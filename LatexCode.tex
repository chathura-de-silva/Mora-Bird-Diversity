The common kingfisher's primary diet consists mainly of small fish, although it also includes insect larvae and, occasionally, frogs. When perched on a branch or reed above the water, the small bird patiently awaits the sight of a potential prey {-} a small fish in the water. Upon spotting its target, the kingfisher executes a swift, vertical plunge into the water with its wings retracted. In an attempt to catch the fish, the bird uses its beak before swiftly taking off again. To subdue and prepare its catch, the kingfisher often strikes the fish several times against a branch.%

The Asian Openbill primarily feeds on large mollusks, particularly Pila species, in shallow water and marshy areas. Using its distinct bill, characterized by a gap that forms with age, the bird separates snail shells from their bodies. The lower mandible's twisted tip aids in this process. The bill gap appears to be an adaptation for handling hard and slippery shells. Foraging involves slow walks with a steady gait, and the bird makes rapid vertical jabs to capture prey. The diet also includes smaller snails, water snakes, frogs, and large insects.%
